# filter



what does it filter?
communication.
specifically, communication between software programs. 

#### actually a browser

but that is not a good name. 
we do not "browse", we seek. 
we do not browse, we read, watch, listen.

we type, we talk, we sing, we present, we perform

we do not browse. the internet is not a supermarket

but it is a market for our attention and we should organize our interaction with our machines in a more useful manner, than just "casually look" at them, otherwise we will not just be exploited by those who might have an influence on what we interact with, but also, we became very susceptible to became stuck in a bubble that we don't even notice. 

most importantly, we should be aware of the origin, the timeframe, the accuracy, the precision and the lifecycle of the data we are looking at and we should be able to navigate among these axis efficiently and with complete transparency. 


I decided I will keep a list of links that perhaps give a better understanding why this repo exist.

i am sick of the current palette.  

yeah i know there are more than 3 browsers, but there is none afaik that does half the things at least that i need

- **transparency everywhere**. i don't mean visually, and i don't mean i want to know everything all the time. but it should be EASY & SIMPLE to check what data the browser is storing, sending, receiving. this is currently easy but definitely not simple, not even for professional web developers. go, ask a C programmer about what they think about how easy or simple debugging browser communication is. (caution: be prepared for a brawl.)
- **better interface** than tabs to keep track of different interests. tabs are terrible and you know it. and why we have a new interface for every website? people cry that websites start to look alike? well it's about time you don't want to force everyone to learn something new just because you want to be perceived as different.
- **better search**. i don't want to google everything, it became tiring. i have hundreds of gigabytes of free space on my hard drive, i am ok with storing lots of data on it. **so why there is no option to build a local database while you are browsing?** think of an extended bookmark system where your history is searchable, configurable (so you can tell the browser what to save and what to not save, so the browser don't just blindly scrapes everything / which would be a terrible idea obviously), and browseable by all kinds of metrics including time and location.  


see where i am going with this? most of what you get from your apps now you could do on your damned smartphone and it would probably take less power because you wouldn't have to communicate with all the sync servers that now save your data in the cloud.

the internet is a trashcan and internet browsers are as much help as half a pair of holey gloves would be for dumpster diving

i want an browser that is built on **event sourcing**. the browser is a platform and i want good platform wide logs about everything.
